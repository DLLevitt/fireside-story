        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
        <p>The sun came up and the storm cleared and stuff.</p>
        <p>Then the stuff began to huff and puff !</p>
        <p> Then he was informed not to have communication with his learners or fellow knowledge sharers during this process </p>
        <p> He is okay, but his plea for mercy went unheard </p>
        <p>The stuff were saddened by such news, yet rejoiced to see that puff was well.</p> 
        <p>Perhaps the trials for puff had just begun. </p>
        <p>Stuff then pondered on their own trials, the late and the unsubmitted, and were uncertain the outcome, with deadline unmet </p>
        <p>Many stuff had this thought arise in their minds as the day had played out</p>
        <p>Steam, arose in ones mind as an answer, and they would wait to hear its silence or acceptance</p>
